The code herein allows the user to generate the required binary masks to be encoded on an appropriate optical device (such as a spatial light modulator) to spatially filter structured light beams (see GenFilterMask.m). Simulation code has also been given to allow the user to see the procedure in action and to explore it on their own for different types of noise and different structured light beams (see SimSpatialFilter.m). Codes to generate Hermite-Gaussian (HG.m), Bessel-Gaussian (BG.m) and Laguerre-Gaussian (LG.m) are also given for convenience and are required to run SimSpatialFilter.m 

Please consider acknowledging our work if you have utilised the code herein.
